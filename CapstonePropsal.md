# Gaming in REACT

### Pokemon RPG 2.0

I am planning on creating a video game using the REACT Framework. This project will use the PokeAPI to make calls to fetch different pokemon to battle an original charecter of my design.
-REACT
-API
-CSS
-Javascript
-Unity (for backgrounds)

##### MVP
The Minimal Viable Project will include:
* My original charaecter battling Pokemon called via the API
* Player stats are randomly generated, making each game unique
* Combat entails player's attack and weapon combine for damage to pokemon and vice versa(pokemon dealing damage to player) for each turn


##### Stretch Goals
The Strech Goals include:
* Use those battles to "Level up" and increase the main charecters stats
* Have dynamic backgrounds that change with each new battle
* having an overworld where my original charecter will be able to explore
* main charecter will have special attacks
